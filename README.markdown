# ZCONV.DART :lock: :joystick:

[![GitHub CI](https://github.com/angeldollface/zconv.dart/actions/workflows/flutter.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/angeldollface/zconv.dart/actions)

***My graphical implementation in Flutter of a number conversion app. :lock: :joystick:***

## ABOUT :books:

Since I implemented my algorithms to convert between different number bases, I thought, to showcase my Flutter skills that I'd give my Dart conversion library a shiny frontend. This repository contains the source code to that shiny frontend.
